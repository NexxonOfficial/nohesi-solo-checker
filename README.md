As the title states, a locally hosted website that you can utilise to see what your position is in the Top 500 (Certification) in regards to solo positioning. No Hesi (at the time I am writing this) doesn't have the utility to view where you stand if you are a solo player, since your position is purely based on the highest amount of points you have *overall*, team or no team. 

## üì¶ Limitations

- Due to the script simply utilising the "No Hesi Public API", **you can only see where your solo position is on the leaderboard if your highest score is SOLO**. If you've got a higher score on the leaderboard as a proximity team, you will not show on this site. This is because it filters out all proxy scores to show only users that have contributed solo scores to the board.

- As of right now you can only search via Steam ID or Display Name that is on your No Hesi Account. If you'd like to see any other search options added feel free to let me know!
